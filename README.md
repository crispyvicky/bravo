## WhatsApp direct submissions (no app open)

These forms send data to your WhatsApp using either Twilio WhatsApp API or Meta's WhatsApp Cloud API via `/api/whatsapp`:

- `src/components/Contact.tsx`
- `pages/start-quest.tsx`

### Option A: Twilio WhatsApp (recommended)

Set the following environment variables:

```
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token
TWILIO_FROM_WHATSAPP=whatsapp:+14155238886   # sandbox or your approved sender
WHATSAPP_RECIPIENT=919398012612             # your number with country code, digits only
```

Notes:
- Join the Twilio Sandbox or use your approved WhatsApp Business sender.
- Ensure your recipient is a sandbox participant or an approved contact.

### Option B: Meta WhatsApp Cloud API (fallback)

```
WHATSAPP_TOKEN=EAAG...      # Permanent token from Meta for Developers
WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID=12xxxxxxxxxxxx  # From WhatsApp Business Account > API Setup
WHATSAPP_RECIPIENT=919398012612         # Your recipient number with country code
```

Notes:
- Make sure the WhatsApp Business API is set up and the recipient number is reachable.
- In development, you may need to use test numbers/templates until your message type is approved.
