    "content": "Most teams get stuck between design and development. Figma is beautiful, but production is brutal. At Bravoo, we built a repeatable blueprint that turns that design chaos into a live product in days—not months.\n\nIn this post, we’ll walk through the playbook we use with founders and product teams.\n\n![Design to production](https://images.pexels.com/photos/1181671/pexels-photo-1181671.jpeg)\n\n---\n\n## 1. Start with “one hero flow”, not the whole app\n\nInstead of trying to “build the entire product”, we zoom in on **one hero flow**:\n\n- The first value moment for the user.\n- The screen sequence the founder is proudest of in Figma.\n- The path that proves the product should exist.\n\nThis keeps scope surgical and lets us ship something real, fast.\n\n> If a flow doesn’t unlock a meaningful before/after for the user, it’s a distraction for v1.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Normalize the Figma file like a codebase\n\nBefore we write a line of code, we clean the Figma file like a dev repo:\n\n![Figma cleanup](https://images.pexels.com/photos/4348403/pexels-photo-4348403.jpeg)\n\n- Rename frames and components to match real domain language.\n- Extract reusable atoms (buttons, inputs, cards) and patterns (sections).\n- Flag risky areas: microcopy TBD, data unknown, API complexity.\n\nBy the end of this step, design tokens and components map 1:1 to what we’ll build in React.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Wire real data as early as possible\n\nWe plug in real or realistic data **before** polish:\n\n- Skeleton states instead of static placeholders.\n- Real API responses (or mock JSON that looks like them).\n- Loading, empty, and error states designed on purpose.\n\n// Example: defensive data mapping\nconst missions = apiMissions ?? [];\n\nreturn missions.length === 0 ? (\n  <EmptyState />\n) : (\n  <MissionsList missions={missions} />\n);This avoids the classic demo trap: a perfect UI that falls apart on the first real payload.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Ship responsive and accessible by default\n\nWe design and code for:\n\n- **Mobile first**: hero flow must feel incredible on a phone.\n- **Keyboard & screen readers**: buttons, links, dialog flows.\n- **Performance budgets**: images optimized, animations measured.\n\n![Responsive product](https://images.pexels.com/photos/1181467/pexels-photo-1181467.jpeg)\n\nGood UX here quietly boosts SEO, activation, and retention—without more marketing spend.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Wrap it with analytics and feedback hooks\n\nA build is only useful if it learns. We always add:\n\n- Event tracking on key actions in the hero flow.\n- Lightweight session recording or heatmaps (where appropriate).\n- A feedback hook: “What’s confusing here?” inline.\n\n**Launch checklist:**\n\n- [x] Hero flow implemented end-to-end\n- [x] Realistic data wired\n- [x] Analytics + error reporting enabled\n- [x] Feedback hook liveNow every user session feeds the next iteration, not just your intuition.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Turn the blueprint into a repeatable system\n\nOnce the first hero flow is live, we turn the blueprint into a **playbook** for the rest of your product:\n\n- Reuse the same component library and layout system.\n- Clone the analytics + feedback wiring for each new flow.\n- Grow from “hero flow” to “feature cluster” without chaos.\n\n---\n\nIf you’re sitting on a beautiful Figma file and a blank production repo, this is exactly the process we’d run with you. The fastest way forward is to pick a hero flow, clean the design, and ship a thin, honest slice to real users.\n\nWant us to run this blueprint on your product?
