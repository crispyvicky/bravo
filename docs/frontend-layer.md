# Frontend Layer Documentation

## Overview

The Frontend Layer consists of the core React application built with Vite, TypeScript, and modern web technologies.

## Key Components

### Main Application Entry Point
- **File**: `src/App.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Main application component that orchestrates the entire frontend
- **Features**:
  - Routing configuration
  - Global state management
  - Layout structure

### Core Dependencies
- **React 18+**: Modern React with hooks and concurrent features
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and better developer experience
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server
- **React Router**: Client-side routing

## Architecture

### Component Structure
```
src/
├── components/     # Reusable UI components
├── pages/         # Page-level components
├── App.tsx       # Main application component
└── main.tsx      # Application entry point
```

### State Management
- Local component state using React hooks
- No external state management library (intentionally simple)

### Routing
- **Home**: `/` - Landing page with all sections
- **Wall of Fame**: `/wall-of-fame` - Client showcase
- **Boss Fights**: `/boss-fights` - Interactive challenges
- **Player One**: `/player-one` - User profile section
- **Not Found**: `/*` - 404 page

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all components
- Follow React functional component patterns
- Use custom hooks for reusable logic
- Implement proper error boundaries

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading for route components
- Optimized images and assets
- Efficient re-renders with proper dependency arrays

### Testing
- Unit tests for components
- Integration tests for pages
- E2E tests for critical user flows
